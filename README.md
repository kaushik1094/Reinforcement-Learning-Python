# Reinforcement-Learning-Python
In this project We are going to use Upper confidence Bound and thomson Sampling algorithms.
In this Algorithm we will use Upper Confidence Bound and thomson Sampling algorithm to predict what is best version of 10 Ad's. 
We will use Reinforcement algorithm, We will use random selection and UCB(Upper confidence Bound) and Thomson sampling alogirthms and compare the reward 
to the random selection and  UCB , Thomson sampling.
